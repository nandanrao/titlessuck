"Master Thesis - Model Predictive Control of export cable temperature in offshore wind farmsOverall project description DONG Energy Wind Power makes use of dynamic rating for export cables of large offshore wind farms. Such design maximises cable utilisation while ensuring safe operating temperature of the conductor. In some environmental conditions, the cable may operate at full load for long periods, which could bring its conductor temperature above the design limit, typically 90o. It is therefore important to develop strategies to ensure proper and efficient conductor temperature control during such operating scenarios. A manual control approach, based on temperature monitoring may be employed, but automatic controllers taking into account wind, WTG status and temperature predictions may be a more optimal solution. Such a tool would require temperature sensing on the cables and accurate cable thermal modelling, as well as the predictive features mentioned above. Detailed project description Based on DONG Energy Wind Power’s available wind farms and cable models, the aim of the project is to develop a model predictive controller (MPC) which ensures safe temperature values on the cable conductors based on predicted power production during high load and long duration conditions. The controller should be applicable and robust, and hence the estimation of the influence of model and wind forecast errors on the control performance should be performed. A preliminary list of the project tasks is the following review of relevant literature in cable modelling and MPC setup of simulation model for control design development of controller from a theoretical and practical perspective implementation of controller in simulation model assessment of control performance robustness analysis with sensitivity analysis or other tools report writing and presentations of results. You will be assisted by DONG Energy Wind Power throughout the project with industrially oriented feedback, relevant data and available tools. You will also be requested to periodically report, via presentations, to industrial supervisors and possibly also to other experts in DONG Energy Wind Power. Functional Area Electrical components and electrical Infrastructure Type Practical and theoretical study Number of students One Academic level Master’s level Desired Start DateSpring 2017, the project may be preceded by a special course.

"PhD Stipend stipend in Adaptive Network Coding (Theory and Designs for Future Networks) (8-16059) At the Faculty of Engineering and Science, Department of Electronic Systems a PhD stipend within Adaptive Network Coding (Theory and Designs for Future Networks) is available within the general study programm Wireless Communications. The stipend is open for appointment from January 1, 2017 or soon hereafter. Job descriptionA PhD stipend focused on the topic of Adaptive Network Coding (Theory and Designs for Future Networks) is opened within the WCN section. This position is part of an Aalborg University Talent Grant recently awarded to Young Research Talents within the University and will focus on revisiting and generalizing theoretical results in network coding and design novel, adaptive network codes, that rely on new finite field constructions that are suited for flexible management of complexity and performance. The project will also aim to deploy such designs in practical systems of interest, ranging from communication networks to distributed storage and data caching (potentially, relying on open source projects, e.g., OpenStack, Hadoop/HDFS, OpenCompute) and demonstrate the results. The study may also provide generalizations to other error-correcting codes, thus setting us in a position to re-discover results in coding theory under the lens of these new finite field constructions.Future communication networks will face tremendous challenges to answer the increasing data traffic generated by end users, the novel requirements of 5G communications that go beyond higher data rates, and by the 50 to 500 billion sensor and actuation devices to be connected with machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies and the Internet of Things. Additionally, upcoming services and applications may also impose very low delay constraints on the transferred data. This will naturally prevent us from using current client-server infrastructures or popular cloud services. The main reason is that servers and cloud infrastructure are typically far away from the end-devices themselves, which translates into high delay to reach them. Furthermore, the costs of transferring massive amounts data all the way through the network to reach a cloud are prohibitive with 50 to 500 billion connected devices due to the economic costs in infrastructure capable of servicing these high loads and the energy costs for transferring to and processing at the cloud. Thus, developing technologies that (i) increase the throughput, (ii) reduce the delay, (iii) operate in a distributed fashion, (iv) are economically viable, and (v) store and process data close to the end devices, is crucial to the design and deployment of future communication networks and these key goals to be addressed by Adaptive Network Codes. This project will also have interactions with companies and local start-ups as well as participation in IETF events with the potential to generate both theory and designs that address real practical challenges, high impact publications in journals and conferences, and patent filings.We are looking for a highly motivated and independent student willing to take the challenge to do a successful 3-year PhD programme in Aalborg University. The ideal candidate will have the following profile (but not all items are required for a successful application): Background on communication systems, networking, distributed storage and distributed systems.  This is highly desired, but candidates from other disciplines will be considered based on their merits and potential.Background on mathematics, probability, and/or error correcting codes is desired.Background on programming, particularly C++, Java, and/or python, is highly desired.Knowledge and experience in network coding is desired. Good English verbal and written skills are a must.Excellent undergraduate and master degree grades are desired.You may obtain further information from Associate Professor Daniel Enrique Lucani Roetter, Department of Electronic Systems, phone: + 0045 99407508, email: del@es.aau.dk concerning the scientific aspects of the stipend.

One will later be selected for the role of team-builder, and the others for the important role of team players.Scan-Con Group A/S will, by the end of the 2016, be launching a ‘state-of-the art’ next level ERP system.Prior to this - part or the whole of the team - will be working together on our existing Job2Sea market expansion effort.

"PhD Stipend stipend in Adaptive Network Coding (Theory and Designs for Future Networks) (8-16059) At the Faculty of Engineering and Science, Department of Electronic Systems a PhD stipend within Adaptive Network Coding (Theory and Designs for Future Networks) is available within the general study programm Wireless Communications. The stipend is open for appointment from January 1, 2017 or soon hereafter. Job descriptionA PhD stipend focused on the topic of Adaptive Network Coding (Theory and Designs for Future Networks) is opened within the WCN section. This position is part of an Aalborg University Talent Grant recently awarded to Young Research Talents within the University and will focus on revisiting and generalizing theoretical results in network coding and design novel, adaptive network codes, that rely on new finite field constructions that are suited for flexible management of complexity and performance. The project will also aim to deploy such designs in practical systems of interest, ranging from communication networks to distributed storage and data caching (potentially, relying on open source projects, e.g., OpenStack, Hadoop/HDFS, OpenCompute) and demonstrate the results. The study may also provide generalizations to other error-correcting codes, thus setting us in a position to re-discover results in coding theory under the lens of these new finite field constructions.Future communication networks will face tremendous challenges to answer the increasing data traffic generated by end users, the novel requirements of 5G communications that go beyond higher data rates, and by the 50 to 500 billion sensor and actuation devices to be connected with machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies and the Internet of Things. Additionally, upcoming services and applications may also impose very low delay constraints on the transferred data. This will naturally prevent us from using current client-server infrastructures or popular cloud services. The main reason is that servers and cloud infrastructure are typically far away from the end-devices themselves, which translates into high delay to reach them. Furthermore, the costs of transferring massive amounts data all the way through the network to reach a cloud are prohibitive with 50 to 500 billion connected devices due to the economic costs in infrastructure capable of servicing these high loads and the energy costs for transferring to and processing at the cloud. Thus, developing technologies that (i) increase the throughput, (ii) reduce the delay, (iii) operate in a distributed fashion, (iv) are economically viable, and (v) store and process data close to the end devices, is crucial to the design and deployment of future communication networks and these key goals to be addressed by Adaptive Network Codes. This project will also have interactions with companies and local start-ups as well as participation in IETF events with the potential to generate both theory and designs that address real practical challenges, high impact publications in journals and conferences, and patent filings.We are looking for a highly motivated and independent student willing to take the challenge to do a successful 3-year PhD programme in Aalborg University. The ideal candidate will have the following profile (but not all items are required for a successful application): Background on communication systems, networking, distributed storage and distributed systems.  This is highly desired, but candidates from other disciplines will be considered based on their merits and potential.Background on mathematics, probability, and/or error correcting codes is desired.Background on programming, particularly C++, Java, and/or python, is highly desired.Knowledge and experience in network coding is desired. Good English verbal and written skills are a must.Excellent undergraduate and master degree grades are desired.You may obtain further information from Associate Professor Daniel Enrique Lucani Roetter, Department of Electronic Systems, phone: + 0045 99407508, email: del@es.aau.dk concerning the scientific aspects of the stipend.

"Who are we? It’s pretty simple, really. Io-Interactive is here to deliver exciting best-in-class gaming experiences. We want our games to play and feel like the people who created them – unique and creative. It is our way of making sure that we will always deliver something interesting.So we do a lot to foster a culture of brother- and sisterhood and we strive to be a collective of creative, productive people rather than a factory. You come to work at Io-Interactive because you want to create top-of-the-line games and because you want to be part of a company that isn’t afraid of doing things differently.Because you will be spending a substantial amount of your day here, we do as much as we can to make IOI feel like a second home. We meet for optional breakfast every morning, have communal lunches and even dinner on those occasionally long days where we need to meet an important deadline.On Fridays we sometimes have our Friday bar – either planned as a big thing where we run around in the building with laser guns or other fun like that – or just spontaneously started somewhere in the building or on our roof top terrace. Every now and then we have IOI days where we can dig into our pet projects or attend presentations from colleagues or external experts on everything game related. It’s all about getting creative, influenced and inspired. What is the job? Io-Interactive is currently looking for a Section Manager to cover the area of art. It’s a bad job if you like to be lonely, but great if you want to work with lots of exceptionally talented artists.You will need to know how to make artists evolve and “grow that extra bit” – both as individuals, as artists, and as part of a group. You need to understand all areas of game development and production and you will need strong human resource skills.As Section Manager you need to be able to identify, plan, and execute artists’ career paths right from recruitment, through projects, and personal development. You will report to IOI’s Production Director and will work with producers on identifying the best creative talent for each project. You also get to manage the designers’ salary studio budget, oversee the evaluation, classification, and rating of seniority and job positions.  You will be the go-to person for our creative people – environment artists, character artists, fx-artists, concept artists, audio designers, outsourcing art and associated support functions. You’ll need to stay in close touch with this group to identify potential, strengths, and issues and help it evolve. You will serve as a link between producers and artists by handling questions, providing contracts, and helping resolve work-related problems as well as help artists to drive constant improvement of our work processes and always find smarter or more efficient and optimal ways of doing things.In addition, you’ll have a good overview of what affects different artists work (including their pipeline). Finally, you will have responsibility for performing difficult staffing duties, such as dealing with understaffing, resolving disputes, warnings and layoffs, and disciplinary procedures.  What is required? We expect you to have strong communication skills, an open and very approachable nature. You must have excellent written and oral communications skills in English.In addition, since you’re working with artists, you need to have a strong sense for good craftsmanship. You need “an eye” to spot when that special talent comes around – and then be able to nurture it. We’re developers with passion for our products so you will at times need to use your strong conflict resolution skills for the greater good. You also need to fully understand the process of game development and production to identify key areas of need and where to focus your work.Experience at a major AAA game development studio in a creative personnel management role is a very big plus for us as is experience with personnel management and evaluation methods and systems. Training in mediation and conflict resolution can be a bonus as will the ability to speak and understand Danish.  Apply now! You made it this far. Clearly you’re ready to know even more. So get in touch now. We need you!Apply Now"

We meet for optional breakfast every morning, have communal lunches and even dinner on those occasionally long days where we need to meet an important deadline.On Fridays we sometimes have our Friday bar – either planned as a big thing where we run around in the building with laser guns or other fun like that – or just spontaneously started somewhere in the building or on our roof top terrace. Every now and then we have IOI days where we can dig into our pet projects or attend presentations from colleagues or external experts on everything game related. It’s all about getting creative, influenced and inspired. What is the job? Io-Interactive is currently looking for a full-time Game Designer to join our next Hitman project.

You will create gameplay and menu flowcharts making sure that features and game mechanics are correctly distributed and represented throughout the game experience. You will become very familiar with IOI’s proprietary tools because you will be setting up gameplay and scripted events displaying the intended operation of the fully working game systems.

You will work on rules for reward systems, progression, game achievements, leaderboards unlock-able content etc. We also expect that you own areas of special expertise within the game design domain agreed with leads or game management (e.g. multiplayer, menus, online features, communities, monetization, AI, dialogue etc.).
